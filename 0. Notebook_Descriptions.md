## Data analysis notebooks for COMM2550 Data Project
## Notebook Descriptions (in order of creation)

Raw_Sports_Data --> This notebook was used to capture all the raw data of the Philly sports teams in one place to compare the natural overlaps within the data to more easily make clean data frames for each sports team.

Clean_Sports_Data --> This notebook created the data frames for the Philly sports teams that we used in our analysis. These clean data frames dropped the unnecessary columns found in the raw data and renamed columns for a more organized set-up.

geo_plotting --> This notebook plots Philly as a map separated by zipcodes so that we can overlay the coordinates of the sports bars and stadiums/arenas of the sports teams on top to visualize.

arrests_analysis --> This notebook cleans and analyzes the arrest data, then sees average arrests a day per month to see any findings regarding patterns of outcome and arrests, and finally graphs arrests on the Philly map with Stadium/Arenas and Sports Bars to find any correlations.

merged_final --> This notebook is the thick of our analysis comparing arrest rates with zipcodes plotted on a map showing the placements of sports bars and stadiums.
